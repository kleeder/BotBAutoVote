# BotBAutoVote

Put all your votes into a csv file and let the script do everything else.
You need the requests and csv-library.
(I realized that using csv is over the top, i could've used a simple text-file, but whatever.. feel free to change that)

## Simple Tutorial

Once you have both libs installed, open the script-file and insert your user_id, serial and botbr_id at rows 5,6,7 (as strings!). (You can get them by checking your botb-cookies while logged in)

Next insert the csv-name (or full path) in row 15. Make sure that your csv-file is properly formatted. It should only contain the entry_id and category-votes. There is an example file added to this repo.

Thats it! You can now run the script. If BotB isnt down, this should work and you can relax while you vote :D
